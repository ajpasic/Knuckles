Finally a software and firmware to control the zortrax or moveo robotic arm.

Features:
-Can control two arduino mega with ramps1.4. A total of 13axis.
-12axis can be played in a single gcode file.
-Why 12 axis? Normally a 6axis robotic arm is not sufficient to solve real world problem.
 So, the extended axis are used to assist the robotic arm to perform task.
-Use joystick to control.
-Support two types of gripper. Magnetic and servo.
-Support motor on/off
-Auto recording of gcode.
-Can play line by line of gcode.
-Can save unlimited gcode file.
-Can return back to home position
-Can control the robotic arm using bluetooth
