If your installation folder is C:\Program Files\Quantum Software\RoboticArm. You have to copy all the stl files into this folder to C:\Program Files (x86)\Quantum Software\RoboticArm. I apologize for the technical issue.

4. Wait till the software cursor stopped. It is searching for com port. Then turn on robotic arm arduino mega 2560 with bluetooth or usb.

5. Choose the comport number. If you use usb cable. The speed is 57600. If you use bluetooth, the speed is unimportant.

6. Everytime you want to connect to the arduino mega with bluetooth after disconnect. You have to off and on the arduino mega first.

7. This software will only work with the included firmware. Load the firmware to arduino first.

8. Try this step to test:

Open desktop software first
Wait till cursor stop
Power on arduino mega with ramps1.4
Choose 57600. Press Connect
Move to a desired position either using the software navigation button or joystick
Press Record
Move to another desired position
Press record
Home
Press Save
Press Play to repeat.


Note:For your info. If you use joystick to control the robotic arm.
You only need to set the steps to 2.
When you push the stick, it will add the steps automatically until you let go.
Like this is so much easier to control.

You can move any motor until you reach a desired position. Then only you press Record.
When you playback. It will go back to that position.
