# Summary

Continuation of my previous project, see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2122538 for reference.

This is a work in progress! I didn't print out a test assembly of this just yet, you can try to print this as is but i can't guarantee that all parts will fit (although i'm confident they should)

This gearbox fits on top of a NEMA 17 standard motor and sides of the reducer sit flush with the motor. This gearbox has a 40:1 ratio and double 608z bearings to support the output ring so it can actually deliver torque at the output without unwanted movements inside the assembly. In a 2 bearing version it's ONLY 26mm thick, and in the single bearing version it's going to be only 19mm.
I have yet to see a greater reduction in a smaller package which can be readily mounted on a NEMA 17 motor (such reducers most likely exist, but i haven't seen them)

Anyways, this is WIP, and i'll update it as the project goes along.

UPDATE 15.06.2017 - Fixed non manifold files, reduced file size drastically but kept all details on the same resolution (CATIA STL generation bug caused both of these problems)
