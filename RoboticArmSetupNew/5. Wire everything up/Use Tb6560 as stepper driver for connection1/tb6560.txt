For maximum torque:
Geared stepper motor. Set excitation mode=2. And double the current.
If the motor is rated 1.5amps. Set 3amps since 2 phase exciatation will consume double current. The torque will increase 30percent.

For normal stepper without gear. Set exciattion=1/16 and normal current because exciatation=2, the motor goes too fast.
